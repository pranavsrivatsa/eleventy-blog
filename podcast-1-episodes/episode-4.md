In this episode, we're exploring one of Eleventy's most powerful features: its support for multiple template languages. Unlike other static site generators that lock you into a single templating system, Eleventy gives you the freedom to choose the right tool for each job.

We'll discuss:

- The various template languages supported (Liquid, Nunjucks, Markdown, etc.)
- How to mix and match different template languages in the same project
- Real-world use cases for different template languages
- Tips for choosing the right template language for your needs

This flexibility is one of the reasons why Eleventy has become so popular among developers. Whether you're coming from Jekyll, Hugo, or another static site generator, you'll find a familiar templating language in Eleventy.
