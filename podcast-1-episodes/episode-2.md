In today's episode, we're focusing on one of the biggest advantages of using Eleventy: performance. Static sites generated with Eleventy are incredibly fast because they're pre-rendered into HTML files during the build process. This means no server-side processing is needed when users visit your site.

We'll explore how this translates to real-world benefits:

- Lightning-fast page loads
- Reduced server costs
- Better user experience
- Improved Core Web Vitals scores

We'll also discuss how Eleventy's build process optimizes your content and why this approach is particularly beneficial for content-heavy websites. Join us as we dive deep into the performance metrics that make static sites the preferred choice for many modern web projects.
