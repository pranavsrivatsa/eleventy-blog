Welcome to the first episode of The Eleventy Podcast! Today, we're diving into the world of Eleventy, a simpler static site generator that's gaining popularity among web developers. Unlike other static site generators, Eleventy is framework-agnostic and doesn't require JavaScript to be sent to the browser, making it incredibly fast and efficient.

In this episode, we'll explore what makes Eleventy special and why it might be the perfect choice for your next web project. We'll discuss its zero-config approach, its flexibility with multiple template languages, and how it compares to other popular static site generators like Jekyll and Hugo.

Stay tuned as we unpack the benefits of static site generation and why Eleventy's approach to simplicity and performance is revolutionizing how we build websites.
